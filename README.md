# Fallback to Foundations

_A curated collection of fundamental digital skills and essential software tools._

## 📘 Overview

As a full-stack web developer, I've built my career around code. But in the spirit of being prepared for all scenarios—including the unexpected—I've taken the initiative to strengthen my grasp of essential computer fundamentals and commonly used office tools.

This repository is a personal knowledge base of what I consider **"Plan B" digital skills**, including:

- Basic computer operations
- Microsoft Office tools (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Tally and Tally Prime for accounting
- Other useful productivity tools

Whether you're from a tech background or just starting your digital journey, this repo is designed to help you understand and use these tools effectively.
